# Project Overview
This project is an interactive 3D Product Viewer built using Three.js. It demonstrates the implementation of various 3D graphics concepts including scene setup, mesh composition, lighting, raycasting, animation, and camera controls.

# Features
- Interactive 3D robot model built with basic geometries
- Dynamic lighting with shadows and highlights
- Mouse interaction with part highlighting and information display
- Automatic camera rotation with user control override
- Responsive design that adapts to window resizing

# Technical Implementation
The project is structured into modular components:

- `initScene.js`: Handles scene, camera, and renderer setup
- `createProduct.js`: Creates the 3D robot model using basic geometries
- `addLighting.js`: Implements ambient and directional lighting
- `interaction.js`: Manages mouse interactions and raycasting
- `cameraAnimation.js`: Controls camera movement and auto-rotation

# Technologies Used
- Three.js
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5
- CSS3
